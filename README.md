## Hey, it's me: Matt. 👋

I'm a front-end dev, tech lead, and sometime lawyer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building the next version of the [U.S. Web Design System](https://github.com/uswds/uswds). It's going to go hand-in-hand with the [new web-component flavor](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-elements) of the Design System. It's all very exciting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Lit](https://lit.dev), since that's the library underpinning our web components. I'm also always learning what's new on the web platform. We live in the future, and it's great.

## Stuff I'm proud of

- I'm super proud of everything the USWDS team does every day.
- I briefly worked on the [IRS Direct File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-direct-file-for-free) project with some of the greatest humans working in tech. My part was tiny, mostly writing tests for the front-end knotty tex logic implementation (React/TypeScript)
- I helped launch the [Federal Audit Clearinghouse](https://www.fac.gov/) app. This includes the [static eleventy frontend](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC-Frontend), that we hoped would work as a JAMstack-style client to the Django API, and then the port of all of that code over to templates in the [Django monolith](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/FAC) when it turns out the client app didn't actually work the way we needed it to 😅.
